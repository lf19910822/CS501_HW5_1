About AI:

AI gave me great help in building the infrastructure and the BottomNavigation bar. 
To be honest, AI’s understanding of navigation was even more accurate than mine at the beginning.

I originally thought the detail screen should be at the same level as the home screen, but AI suggested 
placing the detail screen as a sub-level under the home screen. After checking the assignment requirements, 
I found that AI’s understanding was actually more precise than mine.

But AI also made a few small mistakes. For example, it initially didn’t consider saving the state of 
the bottom navigation and didn’t use popUpTo(), which caused page stacking. But overall, AI’s help was tremendous
